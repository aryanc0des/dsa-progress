# DSA Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my Data Structures & Algorithms practice.  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving fundamentals by focusing on **patterns**, not memorizing solutions.

## Current Focus Areas
- Arrays & Hashmaps
- Two Pointer Techniques
- Sliding Window Patterns
- Sorting + Searching Logic
- Recursion (foundation building)

## Approach
- Solve problems in increasing difficulty.
- Write clean, readable code.
- Add comments explaining thought process.
- Revisit and re-solve problems after a few days for reinforcement.

## Problem Sources
- LeetCode
- CodeStudio
- CodeChef
- InterviewBit

Progress will be updated regularly.
